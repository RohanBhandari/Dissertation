\chapter{The Standard Model}
\begin{section}{Overview and Successes}

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a wildly successfull theory and one of the greatest accomplishments in science.
Formulated in the second half of the 20th century, it describes 17 experimentally-observed, fundamental particles and their interactions through the electromagnetic, weak, and strong fundamental forces.
These particles, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sm_particles}, consist of six quarks and six leptons, known as fermions, which comprise the matter particles, along with four gauge bosons and one scalar boson, which mediate particle interactions.

\end{figure}

Formally, the Standard Model is quantum field theory with symmetries described by the group $\mrm{SU}_c(3) \times \mrm{SU}_L(2) \times \mrm{U}_Y(1)$ and with a Lagrangian of
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} &= -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} \nonumber + i\overline{\psi}_i\slashed{D}\psi_i + h.c. \\
            &+ \psi_{i}y_{ij}\psi_{j}\phi + h.c. \nonumber + |D_{\mu}\phi|^2 - V(\phi),
\end{align}
where $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor, $D_{\mu}$ is the gauge covariant derivative, $\slashed{D} = \gamma^{\mu}D_{\mu}$, $\psi_{i}$ are the fermion fields, $\phi$ is the Higgs field, $y_{ij}$ are the yukawa couplings, and h.c. is the hermitian conjugate of the term directly preceeding it.
In the top line, the first term of the Lagrangian describes the interactions of gauge bosons, while the second encodes the interactions between gauge bosons and fermions.
The bottom line describes Higgs physics with the first term describing the Higgs-fermion interactions, the second term encoding the Higgs-gauge boson interactions, and finally, the third term representing the Higgs potential.

As the Standard Model is able to provide predictions across an enormous scope of physics, it has been rigorously tested throughout its history.
For example, Figure~\ref{fig:sm_tests}, shows the agreement between the SM predictions and experimental results for the production cross section of a variety of processes.
Amazingly, all of the measurements, spanning nine order sof magnitude, agree with SM predictions.
At the same time, the Standard Model is the most precisely tested theory in physics with its prediction~\cite{PhysRevLett.109.111807} of the anamalous electron magnetic moment incredibly agreeing with experimental measurements~\cite{PhysRevLett.100.120801,PhysRevA.83.052122} at up to fourteen decimal places, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:ae_values}.

\begin{section}{The Standard Model as an Incomplete Theory}

Despite the impressive successes of the Standard Model, it is incomplete as a fundamental description of the unvierse and many tensions exist between it and both experimental and theoretical concerns.
For example, the Standard Model glaringly leaves out the fundamanetal force of gravity and attempts to construct a theory of quantum gravity have been frought with difficulties.
Furthermore, the Standard Model is unable to explain the substantial astrophysical evidence for dark matter~\cite{Bertone:2004pz,Rubin:1970zza}, which comprises $\sim 80\%$ of the matter in the universe, as it has no suitable candidate that can account for the observed mass density of dark matter.

Additionally, the Standard Model provides no mechanisms for:
\begin{itemize}
\item the origin of neutrino masses
\item the matter-antimatter symmetry
\item the presence of dark energy
\item a grand unified theory of the strong and electroweak forces
\end{itemize}

Because of these issues, the Standard Model is believed to be a low-energy effective field theory with new physics entering at higher energies.
It is, however, not easy to know what form this new physics may take, and thus solutions to the above problems have been used to drive much of the theoretical framework for extending the Standard Model.
In particular, the Hierarchy Problem and the idea of ``naturalness'', described in the section below, are, perhaps, the most significant lampposts in the search for new physics.

\begin{subsection}{The Hierarchy Problem and Naturalness}

The long-awaited discovery of the Higgs boson~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012xdj,Chatrchyan:2013lba,Khachatryan:2014jba,Aad:2014aba,Aad:2015zhl} confirmed the existence of a scalar boson with an observed mass of approximately $125~\GeV$.
This relatively low mass of the Higgs boson, however, creates two related theoretical concerns.
First, the Higgs mass is tied to the electroweak scale by the relation 
\begin{align}
v = \frac{\mh}{\sqrt{2}\lambda_h} \approx 246~\GeV
\end{align}
where $v$ is the higgs vacuum expectation value (vev), $m_H$ is the physical Higgs mass, and $\lambda_h$ is the Higgs Yukawa coupling.
The vev directly dictates the electroweak scale and is only on the order of 100~\GeV.
The next largest known energy scale is that of quantum gravity and is typically defined as the Planck mass, which is on the order of $10^{19}~\GeV$.
The question as to why these two scales are so discrepant is known as the Hierarchy Problem~\cite{Barbieri:1987fn}.

The second question stems from trying to understand the observed mass of the Higgs boson in the prescence of quantum corrections.
The Higgs mass can be broken down into two components, its bare mass, $m_{H,0}$, and contributions from radiative corrections, $\delta m_H^2$, as shown in the equation below
\begin{align}
\mh^2 = m_{H,0}^2 + \delta \mh^2.
\end{align}
As a scalar particle, the Higgs boson mass receives contributions from all massive particles, and in partcular, for a fermion, $f$, the contribution to the Higgs mass at the one-loop level, corresponding to the the diagram shown in Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_fermion_loop}, is of the form
\begin{align}
\delta \mh^2|_f &= -\frac{\lambda^2_f}{8\pi^2}N_f \int^{\Lambda_{UV}} \frac{d^4p}{p^2} \nonumber \\
                &= -N_f\frac{\lambda^2_f}{8\pi^2 } \left[\Lambda^2_{UV} - 6m_f^2\ln\left(\frac{\Lambda_{UV}}{m_f}\right) + 2m_f^2\right] + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\Lambda^2}\right),
\label{eqn:higgs_fermion_correction}
\end{align}
with $\lambda_f$ the Yukawa coupling and $N_f$ the number of fermionic degrees of freedom.
The quantity $\Lambda_{UV}$ is the cutoff of the momentum integral, which represents the approximate scale at which the Standard Model is no longer valid.
In the case that there is no new physics beyond the Standard Model, this would correspond to $\Lambda_{UV} \sim \text{Planck scale} \sim 10^{19}~\GeV$, where effects due to quantum gravity are introduced.

\begin{figure}[tbp!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[angle=0,width=0.40\columnwidth]{fig/higgs_fermion_loop.png}
\end{center}
\caption{The fermionic one-loop Higgs mass correction.}
\label{fig:higgs_fermion_loop}
\end{figure}

In this scenario, the leading term of the Higgs mass corrections is $\mathcal{O}(10^{38}~\GeV^2)$, while, as measured, the squared Higgs mass is only $\mathcal{O}(10^{4}~\GeV^2)$.
For these two values to be consistent with each other, the Higgs bare mass parameter must exactly cancel the correction term at over 30 decimal places of precision.
This high-level of fine-tuning is considered to be ``unnatural'' and has been deemed the Naturalness Problem~\cite{Feng:2013pwa,Craig:2013cxa,Papucci:2011wy,Casas:2014eca}.
While it is entirely plausible that such a fine-tuned cancellation of parameters occurs -- there is no inherent theoretical reason against this, this problem motivates the need for new physics below the Planck scale, particularly physics that naturally incorporates a mechanism for cancelling the quadratic divergence of the $\Lambda_{UV}^2$ term.

\end{subsection}

\chapter{Supersymmetry}
\begin{section}{Natural Supersymmetry}

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is an extension of the Standard Model that introduces a new symmetry that relates fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedoms~\cite{ref:hierarchy1,ref:hierarchy2,Ramond:1971gb,Golfand:1971iw,Neveu:1971rx,Volkov:1972jx,Wess:1973kz,Wess:1974tw,Fayet:1974pd,Nilles:1983ge}.
This symmetry imposes that for every fermionic degree of freedom in the Standard Model, there exists a ``superpartner'' bosonic degree of freedom, and vice versa.
Furthermore, this symmetry dictates that both sets of particles couple to physics at the $\Lambda_{UV}$ scale identitically.

In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)~\cite{Csaki:1996ks}, the Standard Model is extended to include a Higgs sector comprised of two scalar doublets and only the SM superpartners.
The superpartners of fermions are scalars and labeled by prefixing an ``s'' to the beginning of the corresponding SM particle name, while the superpartners of fermions are spin-1/2, labeled by suffixing an ``ino'' to the end of the corresponding SM particle name, and collecticely known as gauginos.
Thus, the SUSY particles consist of 4 higgsinos, 12 squarks, 9 sleptons, and 7 gauginos, where there are 2 scalar particles for each SM fermion in order to preserve the number of degrees of freedom.
The superpartners of SM particles are not necesarily mass eigenstates and can mix.
The gauge and mass eigenstates of the superpartners, along with their properties, are shown in Table~\ref{tab:susy_particles}.

\caption{The additional SUSY particles in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.}
\label{tab:susy_particles}
\end{table}

With the addition of these superpartners, a mechanism for naturally cancelling the radiative corrections to the Higgs mass is apparent, as the Higgs couples to these new massive particles as well, providing additonal radiative corrections that cancel the SM contributions.
For example, for a fermion $f$, the radiative corrections from the corresponding sfermion $\tilde{f}$, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_scalar_loop}, take the form
\begin{align}
\delta \mh^2|_{\tilde{f}} = &+N_{\tilde{f}}\frac{\lambda_{\tilde{f}}}{8\pi^2} \left[-\Lambda^2_{UV} + 2m_{\tilde{f}}^2\ln\left(\frac{\Lambda_{UV}}{m_{\tilde{f}}}\right)\right] \nonumber \\
                            &-N_{\tilde{f}}\frac{\lambda_{\tilde{f}}}{8\pi^2} \left[-2m_f^2 + 4m_f^2\ln\left(\frac{\Lambda_{UV}}{m_{\tilde{f}}}\right)\right] + \mathcal{O}\frac{1}{\Lambda^2_{UV}}
\end{align}
using the relation $\sqrt{2}m_f = \lambda_f\nu$.
Supersymmetry imposes that $N_{\tilde{f}} = N_f$ and $\lambda_{\tilde{f}} = -\lambda_f^2$, and thus, in the case where $m_f = m_{\tilde{f}}$, this perfectly cancels not only the quadratic divergence in Equation~\ref{eqn:higgs_fermion_correction} but also the higher-order corrections, solving the Hierarchy Problem.

\begin{figure}[tbp!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[angle=0,width=0.60\columnwidth]{fig/higgs_scalar_loop.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The scalar one-loop Higgs mass correction.}
\label{fig:higgs_scalar_loop}
\end{figure}

Of course, no superparticles have been observed at the SM scale.
This, however, does not imply that supersymmetry is incorrect but only that if it exists, it is a broken symmetry.
In this scenario where $m_f \neq m_{\tilde{f}}$, the quadratically divergent terms still cancel and what is left is only a lograithmic divergence, mediated by the squared mass difference of the partner particles:
\begin{align}
\delta \mh^2 = N_f\frac{\lambda_s}{8\pi^2} \left(m_f^2 - m_{\tilde{f}}^2\right) \ln\left(\frac{\Lambda_{UV}}{m_{\tilde{f}}}\right) + ...\ .
\label{eqn:total_higgs_correction}
\end{align}
This squared mass difference defines the degree to which the Higgs mass is fine-tuned.

\end{section}

\begin{section}{Phenemonological and Experimental Constraints}

While there is no theoretical prediction for the mass of the supersymmetric particles, there are certain guidelines for what the scale of these masses should be for a given level of fine-tuning that is deemed acceptable.
Firstly, the Higgsino masses are directly controlled by the value of $\mu$, which is related to the electroweak scale by
\begin{align}
-\frac{m_{\Zboson}}{2} = \mh^2 + |\mu|^2,
\end{align}
indicating that the Higgsino masses must be near the electroweak scale, $\sim 200~\GeV$, in order avoid a large fine-tuning of parameters.

The other superparticle masses are constrained by the size of their contributions to the Higgs mass, described in Equation~\ref{eqn:total_higgs_correction}.
Not all superparticles, however, contribute equally to the Higgs mass, and thus the phenemonological constraints for paritcles are proportional to the size of their correction to the Higgs mass.
The largest constraint is on the stop squark masses due to the large Yukawa coupling of the top quark, which implies that the stop masses must be relatively light in order to keep the squared mass difference small and correspondingly the overall contribution small.
This also constrains the mass of the left-handed sbotom squark as it is in a doublet with $\tilde{t}_L$ and thus must not be much heavier.
Finally, the gluino couples to the squarks at the one-loop level, which means it still couples to the Higgs boson at the two-loop order, despite the Yukawa coupling for a gluon being zero.
This constraint on the gluino is looser than for other particles described, but as it is strongly interacting, it has a high cross section at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and is thus an important experimentally accessible one.
Not considering model-dependent concerns, these are generically the only SUSY particles that are required to be light, and the rest of the superparticles may be decoupled at very high energies.
A qualitiative example of a natural SUSY spectrum is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:natural_susy_spectrum}.

\begin{figure}[tbp!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[angle=0,width=0.60\columnwidth]{fig/natural_susy_spectrum.png}
\end{center}
\caption{An example spectrum for natural SUSY.}
\label{fig:natural_susy_spectrum}
\end{figure}

In order to gain a rough quantitative sense of what the mass constraints for these particles are, a measure of the Higgs mass fine-tuning can be constructed as
\begin{align}
\mathcal{N} \equiv \frac{\delta\mh^2}{\mh^2}.
\end{align}
Thus for $\mathcal{N} = 10$, a fine tuning of 1 part in 10, gives bounds of $m_{\tilde{t}} \lesssim 1~\TeV$, correspondingly $m_{\tilde{b}} \lesssim 1~\TeV$, and $\mglu \lesssim 2~\TeV$.

Recent results from the LHC, however, are already starting to threaten these bounds, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cms_susy_results} and Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_susy_results}, with gluino and stop exclusion limits already surpassing these bounds for certain models.
These constraints, however, are largely in the context of \RPC models, where a new quantum number, $R$, is conserved.
\RP is defined per particle as
\begin{align}
P_R \equiv (-1)^{3(B-L)+2s},
\end{align}
where $B$, $L$, and $s$ is the baryon number, lepton number, and spin of the particle, $P_R = +1$ for SM particles and $P_R = -1$ for SUSY particles.
The motivation for requiring that \RP be conserved is that, in this case, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) cannot decay to SM particles and is therefore stable.
For models where the LSP is a neutralino, the LSP is then a strong dark matter candidate.

\label{fig:atlas_susy_results}
\end{figure}

The phenomenology, however, for \RPC (RPC) and \RPV (RPV) SUSY models is very different.
For RPC scenarios, the stable LSP does not interact with the detector and escapes without depositing any energy.
The presence of the LSPs, however, can be inferred by examining the missing transverse momentum in an event, which due to momentum conservation and the negligible transverse momentum of the initial colliding particles, should be 0 in events without LSPs or neutrinos.
Thus, the \MET in an event provides a powerful handle for discriminating signal and background and most analyses search for signatures that include significant amounts of \MET.
In RPV models, however, the LSP is not stable and decays to SM particles, which does not produce a large \MET signature.
Although this disfavor the LSP as a dark matter candidate, it allows RPV models to evade the constraints from RPC searches.
Subsequently, RPV SUSY yields an important class of models that can ease the tension between natural solutions to the hierarchy problem and current experimental limits.

\end{section}

\begin{section}{\RP violating Supersymmetry}

In the MSSM, the additional \RPV terms are
\begin{align}
W_{RPV} = \frac{1}{2}\lambda^{ijk}L_{i}L_{j}\overline{\mrm{e}}_{k} + \lambda^{'ijk}L_{i}Q_{j}\overline{\mrm{d}_{k}} + \frac{1}{2}\lambda^{''ijk}\overline{\mrm{u}}_{i}\overline{\mrm{d}}_{j}\overline{\mrm{d}}_{k} + \mu^{'i}L_{i}H_{u},
\end{align}
where the color indices have been surpressed, the letters $i$, $j$, $k$ denote generation.
The fields $L_{i}$, $Q_{j}$, and $H_u$ are SU(2) doublets corresponding to leptons, quarks, and the Higgs boson, respectively, while $\overline{\mrm{e}}_k$, $u_i$, and $d_j$ are the charged lepton, up-type quark, and down-type quark SU(2) singlets.
The $\mu$ and various $\lambda$ factors are coupling strengths for their corresponding interactions, where $\lambda$ and $\lambda^{''}$ must be antisymmetric in their first and last two indices, respectively, due to gauge invariance.
A full description of RPV SUSY can be found in Reference~\cite{Barbier:2004ez}.

While there is no fundamental theoretical reason forbidding \RP violation, there are significant constraints on these interactions, primarilly due to the lepton number violating (LNV) and baryon number violating (BNV) nature of the $\lambda$, $\lambda^{'}$ and $\lambda^{''}$ couplings, respectively~\cite{Allanach:1999ic}.
The most stringent of these constraints is from proton decay on which current experimental results place a lower bound on the proton half-life of $\mathcal{O}(10^{34}\ \mrm{years})$~\cite{Bajc:2016qcc,Nishino:2009aa}.
Proton decay, however, requires both a lepton number and baryon number violating coupling, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:proton_decay}.
These constraint can be avoided if a mechanism exists to make one of these couplings zero or negligibly small.
Though, there are additional strong limits on the individual LNV and BNV couplings, for example from neutron oscillation and muon-to-electron decay measurements, which are most stringent for the light generations.
Thus, for any mechanism to evade these constraints, it must also motivate smaller couplings for the lighter generations.

\label{fig:proton_decay}
\end{figure}

\begin{subsection}{Miminal Flavor Violating Supersymmetry}

One way to avoid the constraints placed on the RPV couplings is to construct a model by following the structure of minimal flavor violation.
In these Minimal Flavor Volating (MFV) SUSY models~\cite{Csaki:2013we,Krnjaic:2012aj,Csaki:2011ge}, the RPV couplings are related to the SM Yukawa couplings, making the third generation RPV couplings large and those of the first two small.
For example, the $\lambda^{''}$ coupling can be written as
\begin{align}
\lambda^{''}_{ijk} = w^{''} y^{(u)}_i y^{(d)}_j y^{(d)}_k \epsilon_{ijk} V^{*}_{il}
\end{align}
with $w^{''}$ an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ parameter and $y^{(u)}$ and $y^{(d)}$ the up- and down-type Yukawa couplings.
From this, the sizes of the $\lambda^{''}_{ijk}$ couplings can be roughly estimated (using $w^{''} = 1$) are shown in Table~\ref{tab:mfv_couplings}, which depicts the dependence of the coupling strength on generation.
Additionally, in MFV scenarios, the LNV couplings are severly suppressed by neutrino masses, and in the limit of massless neutrinos, are exactly zero.
Thus, the only relevant RPV coupling in MFV SUSY models is the BNV $\overline{\mrm{u}}\overline{\mrm{d}}\overline{\mrm{d}}$ coupling, which is small for the first two generations -- meeting the exact criteria necessary to evade experimental constraints on RPV couplings.
Furthermore, in the case where the LSP is a squark, it will decay promptly and not produce \MET, allowing these models to even evade the constraints placed on results from RPC SUSY searches.

\end{table}

Because of these considerations, MFV SUSY is an intriguing class of models to investigate experimentally.
In particular, due to the high $\glu\glu$ cross-section and large value of $\lambda^{''}_{\mrm{t}\mrm{b}\mrm{s}}$, a search for the pair-production of gluinos that decay via \rpvDecay, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rpv_decay}, is well-motivated.

The remainder of this dissertation is dedicated to describing such a search conducted with the Compact Muon Solenoid detector using $\sqrt{s} = 13~\TeV$ $pp$ collisions.
